# Public Project Template

A template repo for public repos.

## .github

This directory contains GitHub specific configuration.

### ISSUE_TEMPLATE

This directory is where we define templates for GitHub Issues. We've provided two standard kinds of report templates, bug report and feature request.

These templates help users and developers report at the level of detail that we need to take action on a request.

<https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-issue-forms>

### workflows

In this directory we define out automation triggers and actions.
<https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/about-workflows>

### CODEOWNERS

You can use a CODEOWNERS file to define individuals or teams that are responsible for code in a repository.

<https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners>

### Pull Request Template

These are the same as issue templates but are for guiding code contributors.

<https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates#pull-request-templates>

## .gitignore

Here you define what files you don't want tracked by Git. GitHub hosts a great set of defaults here <https://github.com/github/gitignore>.

## LICENSE

All public repos must have a license.

We have included the MIT license as a reasonable default but you are encouraged to change to work for your project. If you are looking for help understanding the differences GitHub provides a site to help explain <https://choosealicense.com/>.
